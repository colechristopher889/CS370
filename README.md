# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
   The goal of this project was to implement RL techniques to teach an agent to move through a maze. The game is called treasure hunter and the goal is for the pirate agent to move through a generated maze with a treasure at the end. Python starter code was provided, I implemented the Q-learning algorithm. The algorithm trained the agent to optimize the path through the maze.
    
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        
   -What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        
   Computer scientists create software to solve problems or provide services. Computer scientists are important to the creation of new systems that can improve quality of life. Computer scientists are an important part of advancement as a species and a buffer to protect humans from technology.
       
   -How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
       
   As a computer scientist I try to approach problems in logical methodical ways. I spend more time analyzing problems than actually working on them, always attempting to work smarter.
        
   -What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        
   My ethical responsibilities align with my morals. Many ethical dilemmas are introduced by technology everyday, I can only do my best to deal with them responsibly and ethically.
